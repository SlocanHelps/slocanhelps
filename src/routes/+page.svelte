	Shared Resources for Communities affected by the Slocan Lake & Kootenay Lake Wildfires
</h2>

<p>
	This is a community-led site to care for our friends and neighbours during these difficult
	times. We're just starting to build this resource, so please bear with us and please <a
		class="btn-sm variant-ghost-secondary"
		href="/contribute">contribute</a
	> if you're able.
</p>

<p>
	If you've been evacuated, are under alert, or are looking for information about the wildfires,
	please start by accessing the <a class="btn variant-ghost-primary" href="/resources"
		>Provincial and District Resources</a
	> as they are the most up-to-date and comprehensive sources of information.
</p>

<p>
	If you're an evacuee looking for help, you can <a
		href="/offers"
		class="btn variant-ghost-primary">View Offers of Help</a
	>.
</p>

<p>
	If you have something to offer evacuees, you can <a
		href="https://slocan.getgrist.com/forms/qhosjjXEfVpTGCTrVacWne/25"
		class="btn variant-ghost-primary">Offer Your Help</a
	>.
</p>

<p>
	We'll try to add more resources and information as we can. If you have any questions or need
	help, please contact Blaine <a href="mailto:romeda@gmail.com">by email</a> at romeda at gmail
	dot com or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/romeda">via Facebook Messenger</a>.
