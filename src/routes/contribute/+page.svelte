<h2 class="h2">How to contribute</h2>

<p>
	Offering assistance to your neighbours is an amazing thing to do, and we're all grateful for
	it. Running this site takes some effort, and is currently run by an evacuee (<a
		href="https://facebook.com/romeda">Blaine</a
	>, who is evacuated from Enterprise Creek and currently in Nelson). Any help is greatly
	appreciated, whether it's getting the word out about this resource or helping to keep it
	running smoothly.
</p>

<p>
	If this is something you'd like to help with, please feel free to reach out. I can be
	contacted at 250 278 7978 or romeda at gmail dot com or via Facebook Messenger.
